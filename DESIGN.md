## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 System Design
Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **GUI Layer** (Tkinter) - Handles user interaction and display
- **Game Logic Layer** - Chess rules, board state, move validation
- **AI Layer** (Optional) - Chess engine integration (e.g., Stockfish)
- **Data Layer** - Board representation and game state management

This design allows for easy swapping of AI engines or game modes without affecting the GUI or core logic.

### 3.2 Main Components
<!-- List the major components/modules needed -->

- **ChessBoard**: Represents the 8x8 board and piece positions
- **Piece**: Represents individual chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, etc.)
- **Game**: Manages game state, turn logic, and move validation
- **GUI/ChessApp**: Tkinter window and user interface
- **AIEngine** (Optional): Interface for chess bot integration (e.g., Stockfish)
- **MoveValidator**: Validates moves according to chess rules

### 3.3 Data Flow
User clicks on board → GUI captures event → Game validates move → Board updates → AI makes move (if enabled) → GUI refreshes display

---

## 4. Data Structures

### 4.1 Board Representation
The chess board will be drawn using Tkinter canvas lines:
- 8x8 grid drawn with black lines on a light canvas background
- Each square is clickable and responds to mouse events
- Squares can be highlighted to show valid moves
- Canvas coordinates map to chess board positions (a1-h8)

### 4.2 Piece Representation
Pieces will be represented as sprite images on the canvas:
- Each piece type (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) has a sprite image
- Sprites are positioned on the board based on piece data
- Pieces can be selected and dragged (visual feedback)
- Sprites can be highlighted or grayed out based on game state

### 4.3 Game State
Game state tracks:
- Current board position (which piece is on which square)
- Whose turn it is (White or Black)
- Move history (for undo functionality)
- Game status (active, checkmate, stalemate, check)
- Captured pieces

---

## 5. Game Rules & Logic

### 5.1 Movement Rules
All piece movements follow standard FIDE (International Chess Federation) rules:
- **Pawn**: Moves 1 square forward (2 on first move), captures diagonally forward
- **Rook**: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically
- **Knight**: Moves in L-shape (2+1 or 1+2 squares)
- **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally
- **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- **King**: Moves 1 square in any direction

No pieces can move through other pieces (except Knight).

### 5.2 Special Moves
Implement the following FIDE special moves:
- **Castling** (if both King and Rook haven't moved, no pieces between them, King not in check)
- **En Passant** (Pawn capture of opponent's pawn that just moved two squares)
- **Pawn Promotion** (Pawn reaching the 8th rank promotes to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight)

### 5.3 Win/Loss Conditions
- **Checkmate**: Opponent's King is in check and has no legal moves → Current player wins
- **Stalemate**: Opponent's King is NOT in check but has no legal moves → Draw
- **Resignation**: Player chooses to give up → Opponent wins
- **Draw by agreement**: Both players agree to draw
- **Insufficient material**: Neither player has enough pieces to checkmate

## 6. User Interface

### 6.1 UI Design
Simple graphical window-based interface that launches when the user runs the executable:
- **Windows**: Launches from .EXE file
- **macOS**: Launches from .APP application package
- **Linux**: Launches from executable or application launcher
The window will display the chess board and game interface with no command-line interaction required.

### 6.2 User Interactions
- Click on chess pieces to select them
- Click on valid destination squares to move pieces
- Visual feedback for valid moves
- Pop-up dialogs for game events (checkmate, promotion, etc.)
- **Help button**: Opens a dialog displaying game rules and piece movements
- Game status display showing current turn, check status, game outcome

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Data Structures
<!-- Initial project structure and basic pieces -->

- [x] Create folder structure (gui/, game/, ai/, utils/)
- [x] Create Piece class (base class for all pieces)

- [x] Test data structures with print statements

### 7.2 Phase 2: Game Logic & Move Validation

- [x] Implement check detection
- [x] Implement checkmate detection
- [x] Implement stalemate detection
- [x] Implement move history/undo functionality

- [ ] Add buttons (New Game, Undo, Reset)
- [ ] Add Rules/Help dialog
- [ ] Add game over dialog (Checkmate/Stalemate)
- [ ] Add pawn promotion dialog
- [ ] Test GUI interactions

### 7.4 Phase 4: Polish & Distribution
<!-- Testing and refinement -->

- [ ] Code review and refactoring
- [ ] Add comprehensive comments
- [ ] Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Create .gitignore entries for build files
- [ ] Create executable for Windows (.exe)

- [ ] Final testing on all platforms
- [ ] Update README with how to run executables

## 8. Technical Decisions

### 8.1 Language & Libraries
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (built-in)
- **Optional Dependencies**: python-chess (chess logic helpers), stockfish (AI engine - future feature)
- **Cross-platform**: No OS-specific dependencies required
