## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 System Design
Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **GUI Layer** (Tkinter) - Handles user interaction and display
- **Game Logic Layer** - Chess rules, board state, move validation
- **AI Layer** (Optional) - Chess engine integration (e.g., Stockfish)
- **Data Layer** - Board representation and game state management

This design allows for easy swapping of AI engines or game modes without affecting the GUI or core logic.

### 3.2 Main Components
- **ChessBoard**: Represents the 8x8 board and piece positions
- **Piece**: Represents individual chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, etc.)
- **Game**: Manages game state, turn logic, and move validation
- **StandardChessRules**: Piece movement and special-move legality checks
- **GUI/ChessApp**: Tkinter window and user interface
- **AIEngine** (Optional): Interface for chess bot integration (e.g., Stockfish)
- **Notation Builder**: Generates move notation history from validated moves
- **Notation Parser**: Reads stored notation and converts it into executable moves
- **Replay Controller**: Supports stepping forward/backward through saved moves

### 3.3 Data Flow
User clicks on board → GUI captures event → Game validates move → Board updates → AI makes move (if enabled) → GUI refreshes display

---

## 4. Data Structures

### 4.1 Board Representation
The chess board will be drawn using Tkinter canvas lines:
- 8x8 grid drawn with black lines on a light canvas background
- Each square is clickable and responds to mouse events
- Squares can be highlighted to show valid moves
- Canvas coordinates map to chess board positions (a1-h8)

### 4.2 Piece Representation
Pieces will be represented as sprite images on the canvas:
- Each piece type (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) has a sprite image
- Sprites are positioned on the board based on piece data
- Pieces can be selected and dragged (visual feedback)
- Sprites can be highlighted or grayed out based on game state

### 4.3 Game State
Game state tracks:
- Current board position (which piece is on which square)
- Whose turn it is (White or Black)
- Last move metadata (for en passant and future notation)
- Draw tracking state (halfmove clock, repetition history)
- Game status (active, check, checkmate, stalemate, draw)
- Captured pieces
- Notation move history
- Replay cursor/index for step-by-step navigation

---

## 5. Game Rules & Logic

### 5.1 Movement Rules
All piece movements follow standard FIDE (International Chess Federation) rules:
- **Pawn**: Moves 1 square forward (2 on first move), captures diagonally forward
- **Rook**: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically
- **Knight**: Moves in L-shape (2+1 or 1+2 squares)
- **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally
- **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- **King**: Moves 1 square in any direction

No pieces can move through other pieces (except Knight).

### 5.2 Special Moves
Implemented FIDE special moves:
- **Castling**
- **En Passant**
- **Pawn Promotion**

### 5.3 Win/Loss Conditions
- **Checkmate**: Opponent's King is in check and has no legal moves → Current player wins
- **Stalemate**: Opponent's King is NOT in check but has no legal moves → Draw
- **Threefold repetition**: Same position repeated three times → Draw
- **Threefold repetition (simplified)**: Same board piece placement repeated three times → Draw
- **Note**: Castling rights and en passant rights are intentionally not part of repetition matching in this project.
- **Fifty-move rule**: 100 half-moves without pawn move/capture → Draw
- **Insufficient material**: Neither player has enough pieces to checkmate → Draw
- **Resignation** (planned)
- **Draw by agreement** (planned)

## 6. User Interface

### 6.1 UI Design
Simple graphical window-based interface that launches when the user runs the executable:
- **Windows**: Launches from .EXE file
- **macOS**: Launches from .APP application package
- **Linux**: Launches from executable or application launcher
The window will display the chess board and game interface with no command-line interaction required.

### 6.2 User Interactions
- Click on chess pieces to select them
- Click on valid destination squares to move pieces
- Visual feedback for valid moves
- Pop-up dialogs for game events (checkmate, promotion, etc.)
- **Help button**: Opens a dialog displaying game rules and piece movements
- Game status display showing current turn, check status, game outcome

## 8. Technical Decisions

### 8.1 Language & Libraries
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (built-in)
- **Optional Dependencies**: python-chess (chess logic helpers), stockfish (AI engine - future feature)
- **Cross-platform**: No OS-specific dependencies required

### 8.2 Code Organization

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Unit Tests
- Piece movement legality
- Special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
- Check/checkmate/stalemate detection
- Draw conditions (threefold repetition, fifty-move, insufficient material)
- Notation output and import replay-to-final-state
- Replay-control tests (passing)

### 9.2 Integration Tests
- End-to-end move sequences (opening patterns, checkmates, draws)
- GUI interaction tests (after UI phase)

---

## 10. Notes & References
- Current immediate priority: GUI layer implementation and replay controls integration into the UI.
- Keep engine logic deterministic and test-first as notation features are added.
